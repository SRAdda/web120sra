  <h2>Responsive Website vs Native Mobile Application</h2> 

    <p>The importance of mobile apps has been researched by numerous developers that have paved the way with complex 
    code and guidelines, enabling most users to access resources on the internet. These apps make the internet consistently
    more available to individuals who previously did not have access for various reasons. Using the same url with the addition
    of redirects keeps your SEO still optimized but still provide an excellent user experience.</p> 
    <p>“Sixty percent of the young adults with disabilities...indicated they were employed outside the home, employment 
    outcomes for individuals with IDD were lower (38.8% of respondents with intellectual disabilities, 37% of those with
     autism)”. (Roach, Phd.) </p>
    <p>“Mobile has revolutionized the way we use the web. This is especially true of disabled users, for whom mobile devices 
    open the door to a whole new spectrum of interactions. And they are taking advantage of it. “ (VanToll, 2014)</p>
