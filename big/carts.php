  <h2>Shopping Carts</h2> 

    <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-object-oriented-programming-2" target="_blank"><b>PHP Object Oriented Programming</b></a> by Kevin Skolund provides us with a great review of OOP where he breaks down the procedure with clear explanations of the whys and wherefores. He continues to
With instruction on constructor methods and arguments, cloning, assignment by reference and much more.

    <p>In "Total up a shopping cart" in his LinkedIn Learning series, Joe Chellman, shares his expertise and reminds us that JavaScript is the only (at least for now)
    client-side scripting language but is also gaining popularity for server-side programming. Using variables and functions Chellman developed a complete
 consol.log method, following up with code that calculated totals. It actually took very little time. The issue to me is that you need to change the code in 
the program if you add or need to change details of a variable. This seems to be more appropriate for item inventory that doesn't change very often.</p>
