 <h3>Dance, Dogs and Travel.</h3>
<p>I love to see live dance performances and musicals. Seattle offers world class productions which I attend regularly.</p>
 <p>Another passion of mine in travel. I feel fortunate to have visited Canada, Japan, Morocco, England, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France and Italy, where I enjoyed an extended stay of several years.</p>

 <h3>Adopt a Rescue</h3>
 <img src="images/tablet.jpg" class="tablet" alt="Cute group of Dogs" />
 <p>I adore dogs and smile whenever I see one. Dogs are amazing; they have a natural ability to pacify humans. There are those that never had the good fortune of a loving person to take care of them, so they developed bad behavior out of fear. </p><p>Whenever someone adopts a rescue, another creature of the earth has the opportunity to give his/her new person a huge amount of emotional support.
 I highly encourage you to try it!</p>
